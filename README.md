## Projects

### MyPropertyMap Vector-Tile Renderer
High-performance custom vector-tile renderer using OpenLayers and Google Maps JavaScript API. Reduced memory footprint by 70% and API calls by 50%.

### Tile Prefetching & Caching System
Engineered intelligent tile prefetching and caching strategies to improve map load times and minimize Google Maps API usage for large-scale property views.

### Places API Search Integration
Built a dynamic property search interface leveraging Google Places API with auto-complete, geospatial filters, and relevance ranking for real estate listings.

### Quantum Variational Circuit Simulator
Created a Python-based simulator for parameterized quantum circuits, supporting variational algorithms and gate-by-gate optimization routines, with visualization in a Next.js frontend.

### VQE & Grover’s Algorithm Modules
Implemented core modules for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Grover’s search algorithm in the simulator, enabling experimentation with near-term quantum performance models.

## Achievements
- Solved over 350 algorithmic challenges on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.
- Guided teams to improve delivery velocity by 40% and reduce hosting costs by 35%.
- Secured a competitive internship in Quantum Technology at IIT Delhi.

## Goals for 2025
- Advance expertise in cloud-native architectures and DevOps best practices.
- Contribute to open-source projects in geospatial mapping and quantum computing.
- Transition to opportunities in Europe or the USA by 2026.
